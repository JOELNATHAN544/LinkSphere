## PR Title and Description Requirements

To maintain a high-quality codebase and help reviewers, we have automated workflows that check your PR title and description. Please follow these guidelines:

### PR Title
- **Be descriptive and specific.**
- **Minimum 10 characters.**
- **Avoid generic titles** like `update`, `fix`, `wip`, `test`, or `changes`.
- Example: `Add user email verification flow to registration`

### PR Description
- **Clearly explain what your PR does and why.**
- **Minimum 20 characters.**
- Include context, motivation, and any relevant details for reviewers.
- Example:
  > This PR implements email verification for new users. It adds a verification email step to the registration process and updates the user status accordingly.

### What Happens If You Donâ€™t Follow These?
- If your PR title or description does not meet the requirements:
  - A friendly bot will comment and ask you to update it.
  - You have up to 5 attempts or 30 minutes from your last update to fix the issue.
  - If not fixed, your PR will be closed.
  - You can always open a new PR with the correct information!

**Tip:** Please address any feedback from the bot promptly to avoid your PR being auto-closed.

## General Guidelines
- **Write clear, maintainable code.**
- **Add tests** for new features or bug fixes when possible.

- **Be respectful and constructive** in code reviews and discussions.
